# Getting Started
To get right up and started,  you need to have these prerequisites..
- Maven (if using eclipse, install Maven Integration for Eclipse)
- jUnit 4
- Java
- WebDriver (Chrome, Firefox, IE, etc)

### Drivers
Currently, not all drivers are not packaged with this project, but they may be in the future!
- [Chromedriver](https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list)
- Firefox driver IS actually packaged with the Selenium jar.
- [IEDriver](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list)

Launch your IDE, and under ```src/tests/java``` you'll find a file under the ```functional``` package.  This is a very short a simple test. 
If you do not have Chromedriver installed, just switch the browser to ```FIREFOX``` and right click the file and ```Run As -> jUnit Test```
